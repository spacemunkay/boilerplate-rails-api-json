# About
Boilerplate for a RESTful JSON rails-api using Postgres.  The goal is to create a template for most APIs such that only the domain specific models & logic need to be added.

## Authentication Procedure
Users are required to register and confirm their email address.  Once registered, upon login they receive a token that can be sent in the headers of future requests for authorization.  Once issued, the token does not change, however I plan on adding the ability for a user to renew their token.  See `spec/requests/users_spec.rb` for details.

## What's Added
* Rspec preconfigured w/ FactoryGirl.
* Rspec integration tests for User Registration, Confirmation, Login, & Logout.
* API Versioning via requests, aka, 'api/v1/...' & ability to specify version in request headers if enabled.
* Added functionality such that logging out invalidates an auth token.
* Yea, it's not too much yet, but every bit counts.
